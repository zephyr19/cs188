            <h2><a id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
            <p>This minicontest involves a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. Your team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on your home side. The contest code is available as a zip archive (<code><a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/assets/files/minicontest2.zip">minicontest2.zip</a></code>).</p>

            <p><b>You may choose to work alone or with one partner.</b> There is room to bring your own unique ideas, and there is no single set solution. Much looking forward to seeing what you come up with!</p>

          <h2><a id="ExtraCredit"></a>Extra Credit</h2>
          <p>Extra credit points are earned on top of the 25 points available in P2. E.g. if you earn 1 point of EC through the mini-contest and had a 25/25 on P2, then you'll have 26/25 on P2.</p>

          <p>Your agent will be tested on Gradescope against the baseline and a few staff agents on several selected maps in <code>layouts/</code>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>0.5 points for over 51% winning rate against the provided baseline agent in <code>baselineTeam.py</code>.</li>
            <li>0.5 points for over 51% winning rate against "Staff Agent 1".</li>
            <li>0.5 points for over 51% winning rate against "Staff Agent 2".</li>
            <li>0.5 points for over 51% winning rate against "Staff Agent 3".</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Students that perform well in the <b>final</b> leaderboard, <b>ranked by "final score" metric</b>, will receive the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1st place: 2 points</li>
            <li>2nd and 3rd place: 1.5 points</li>

          <h2><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The primary change between the first and second contests is that now it is an <em>adversarial game</em>, involving two teams competing against each other. Your team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on your home side.</p>

          <p>Your agents are in the form of ghosts on your home side and Pacman on your opponent's side. Also, you are now able to <b>eat your opponent when you are a ghost</b>. If Pacman is eaten by a ghost before reaching his own side of the board, he will explode into a cloud of food dots that will be deposited back onto the board.</p>

          <p>Note that the contest framework, provided in <code><a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/assets/files/minicontest2.zip">minicontest2.zip</a></code>, has changed slightly from <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/minicontest1.html">Contest 1</a>. The functions and interfaces are nearly the same, but maps now include power capsules and you can eat your opponents.</p>

          <p>External libraries: in this contest, you are allowed to use <b>numpy</b> as a dependency.</p>

        <div class="project">
          <h2><a id="Rules"></a>Rules</h2>
          <h3>Layout</h3>
          <p>The Pacman map is now divided into two halves: blue (right) and red (left). Red agents (which all have even indices) must defend the red food while trying to eat the blue food. When on the red side, a red agent is a ghost. When crossing into enemy territory, the agent becomes a Pacman.</p>
          <p>There are a variety of layout in the <code>layouts</code> directory.</p>

          <h3 id="Scoring">Scoring</h3>
          <p>As a Pacman eats food dots, those food dots are stored up inside of that Pacman and removed from the board. When a Pacman returns to his side of the board, he "deposits" the food dots he is carrying, earning one point per food pellet delivered. Red team scores are positive, while Blue team scores are negative.</p>
          <p>If Pacman gets eaten by a ghost before reaching his own side of the board, he will explode into a cloud of food dots that will be deposited back onto the board.</p>
          
          <h3>Power Capsules</h3>
          <p>If Pacman eats a power capsule, agents on the opposing team become "scared" for the next 40 moves, or until they are eaten and respawn, whichever comes sooner. Agents that are "scared" are susceptible while in the form of ghosts (i.e. while on their own team's side) to being eaten by Pacman. Specifically, if Pacman collides with a "scared" ghost, Pacman is unaffected and the ghost respawns at its starting position (no longer in the "scared" state).</p>

          <h3>Observations</h3>
          <p>Each agent can see the <b>entire state</b> of the game, such as food pellet locations, all pacman locations, all ghost locations, etc. See the GameState section for more details.</p>

          <h3>Winning</h3>
          <p>In this adversarial game, a team wins when they return all but two of the opponents' dots. Games are also limited to 1200 agent moves (moves can be unequally shared depending on different speeds - faster agents get more moves). If this move limit is reached, whichever team has returned the most food wins.</p>
          <p>If the score is zero (i.e., tied) this is recorded as a tie game.</p>

          <h3>Computation Time</h3>
          <p>Each agent has 1 second to return each action. Each move which does not return within one second will incur a warning. After three warnings, or any single move taking more than 3 seconds, the game is forfeit. There will be an initial start-up allowance of 15 seconds (use the <code>registerInitialState</code> function).</p>

        <div class="project">
          <h2><a id="DesigningAgents"></a>Designing Agents</h2>
          <p>An agent now has the more complex job of trading off offense versus defense and effectively functioning as both a ghost and a Pacman in a team setting. The added time limit of computation introduces new challenges.</p>

          <h3>Baseline Team</h3>
          <p>To kickstart your agent design, we have provided you with a team of two baseline agents, defined in <code>baselineTeam.py</code>. They are quite bad. The <code>OffensiveReflexAgent</code> simply moves toward the closest food on the opposing side. The <code>DefensiveReflexAgent</code> wanders around on its own side and tries to chase down invaders it happens to see.</p>

          <h3>File Format</h3>
          <p>You should include your agents in a file of the same format as <code>myTeam.py</code>. Your agents must be completely contained in this one file.</p>

          <h3>Interface</h3>
          <p>The <code>GameState</code> in <code>capture.py</code> should look familiar, but contains new methods like <code>getRedFood</code>, which gets a grid of food on the red side (note that the grid is the size of the board, but is only true for cells on the red side with food). Also, note that you can list a team's indices with <code>getRedTeamIndices</code>, or test membership with <code>isOnRedTeam</code>.</p>

          <h3>Distance Calculation</h3>
          <p>To facilitate agent development, we provide code in <code>distanceCalculator.py</code> to supply shortest path maze distances.</p>

          <h3>CaptureAgent Methods</h3>
          <p>To get started designing your own agent, we recommend subclassing the <code>CaptureAgent</code> class. This provides access to several convenience methods. Some useful methods are:</p>

          <p>There are four slots for agents, where agents 0 and 2 are always on the red team, and 1 and 3 are on the blue team. Agents are created by agent factories (one for Red, one for Blue). See the section on designing agents for a description of the agents invoked above. The only team that we provide is the <code>baselineTeam</code>. It is chosen by default as both the red and blue team, but as an example of how to choose teams:</p>
          <div class="code_example"><p></p><pre>python capture.py -r baselineTeam -b baselineTeam</pre><p></p></div>
          <p>which specifies that the red team <code>-r</code> and the blue team <code>-b</code> are both created from <code>baselineTeam.py</code>. To control one of the four agents with the keyboard, pass the appropriate option:</p>
          <div class="code_example"><p></p><pre>python capture.py --keys0</pre><p></p></div>
          <p>The arrow keys control your character, which will change from ghost to Pacman when crossing the center line.</p>
          
          <h3>Layouts</h3>
          <p>By default, all games are run on the <code>defaultcapture</code> layout. To test your agent on other layouts, use the <code>-l</code> option. In particular, you can generate random layouts by specifying <code>RANDOM[seed]</code>. For example, <code>-l RANDOM13</code> will use a map randomly generated with seed 13.</p>

          <h3>Recordings</h3>
          <p>You can record local games using the <code>--record</code> option, which will write the game history to a file named by the time the game was played. You can replay these histories using the <code>--replay</code> option and specifying the file to replay.</p>
